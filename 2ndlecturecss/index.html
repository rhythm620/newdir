    <h1 style="color: red;" style="margin-left: 50px;"><u>Ozymandias</u> </h1>
    <h3 style="color: black;">by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <br>
        <p style="color: #964B00;" style="justify-content: center;">I met a traveller from anantique land,<br/>
            Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
            Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand,<br/>    
            Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
            And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
            Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
            The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: <br>
            And on the pedestal these words appear: <br>
            "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: <br>
            Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br>
            Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
            Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
            The lone and level sands stretch far away.
        </p>
